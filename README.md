team_2_analyse is a python package that contains seven functions.

1. dictionary_of_metrics(): receives an input(list) and calculates statistical metrics, namely the mean, median, standard deviation, variance, minimum value and the maximum value.

2. five_num_summary(): receives an input(list) and calculated the five-number summary. It calculates the maximum value, minimum value, median, the first and third quartile.
